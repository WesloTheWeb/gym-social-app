## About the Project
This project is a social media - esque app themed around gym. Common themes here are status updates, user profiles, etc. The goal of this project was to create a full stack web application that has a functional front end and back end. Essentially learning and database practice with the backend. This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
